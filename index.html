            <p>Clash Royale mainly received positive reviews, with TouchArcade's Eli Hodapp calling it "absolutely phenomenal" in his five star review.Pocket Gamer's Harry Slater gave the game a score of 9/10, summing up "It's an incredible amount of rewarding fun, it's nail-biting at times, and there's content here that will keep you busy for weeks if not months."Writing for Geek.com, James Plafke criticized "Clash Royale for being genuinely fun more so than Clash of Clans while the developer chronically interrupts the player from enjoying it."Clash Royale has received a very positive response from its players, with an average score of 4.5 out of 5 on the Google Play Store and an average score of 4 out of 5 on the App Store. The game has been widely criticized for its business model in which it attempts to encourage players to purchase ingame currency out of anger.
Players battle through 9 arenas (excluding Training Camp) each requiring a certain amount of trophies. Players may also form clans. Clan members may engage in "friendly battles" with one another, the outcome of which does not affect trophies or chests, however contribute to the 'practice with friends' achievement. The "friendly battle" feature allows for live spectating from other clanmates. Clan members may also donate or request cards from one another.
In July 2016, Supercell introduced a new "Tournament" feature. The feature is unlocked at level 8. Tournaments can only be created by using gems, but anyone may join. Based on tournament performance, players are rewarded with tournament chests.</p>

            <p>The player flies around a little black creature named Clony through the woods of the game. Beginning in Day 1, the game progresses through four stages which consist of Dawn, Noon, Dusk, and Night, each with a separate color scheme and new theme of traps. As the player goes through Day 1, egg shaped machines begin to come out of the water of the background. Heading into night, the machines begin to turn on and the game becomes harder as the machines become part of the dangers of the forest. Eventually the character succeeds in disabling the machines and the machines become dormant once again, until Day 2 begins it all over. Most of Day 2 is similar in plot structure, but smaller octopus-like machines begin to make themselves known and the animals in the forest begin to disappear. The last level includes saving a rabbit that was hanging by its foot and eventually coming to fly in front of a giant eye of one of the machines, leaving a cliffhanger into possible future updates. Also included in the game are possible in-app purchases that continue the story with some of Clony's friends, including ones nicknamed Snorf and Fury, featured in their own level packs. Early 2014, level pack Doomsday was released, featuring Fury and his escape from the machine infested woods. Also included is the Daydream level pack in which Snorf escapes finding the magic of the forest makes the woods not all as it seems to be.</p>
